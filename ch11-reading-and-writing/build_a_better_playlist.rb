 Instead of using your old shuffle, write a new music_shuffle method. It should take an array of filenames 
 (like those listed previously) and mix them up good and proper. Youâ€™ll probably need to use the split method for strings. 
 It returns an array of chopped-up pieces of the original string, split where you specify, like this: 
	awooga = 'this/is/not/a/daffodil'.split '/'
